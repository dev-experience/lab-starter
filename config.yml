tagline: Learn how to write a good JavaScript function
description: Mini course to learn best practices of creating good JavaScript functions

# Repository setup
# The following section template information for the repository
# This will be used when the repository is crated for each individual learner

template:
  name: js-functions
  repo: js-functions-template

# `before` block
# Actions to take place after the learner registers, but before they start interacting with their repo

before:
- type: # the type of action, full list at https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/
  # some actions require additional options, those should appear below `type:`
  # you can execute multiple actions in the `before` block

# Steps for the course
# A list of steps that take the learner through the course
# Create one step for each action that a learner will complete

steps:
- title: Create an empty function
  description: Checking out the basic syntax
  event: push
  actions: # a list of the actions that will occur when the step is triggered by an event
  - type: # the type of action, full list at https://lab.github.com/docs/actions

- title: Naming the function properly
 description: Good naming is important to write readable code
